## Exploratory Data Analysis
### 5 – Number Summary: Residential Sale Price and Gross Square Feet
We have analyzed the Residential Sale Prices and Residential Gross Square Feet of Richmond Hill since 2009 and compared them with other neighborhoods in Queens using five-number summaries. This analysis continues our previous analysis covering market trends, growth rates, sales distributions, and correlations between property size and sale value.
The Gross Square Footage data analysis shows that Richmond Hill properties range from a minimum of 504 sqft to a maximum of 60,000 sqft. The median residential gross square footage of Richmond Hill is 1,616 sqft, indicating that properties in Richmond Hill are slightly smaller than those in Jamaica, Jamaica Estates, and Kew Gardens.

The analysis of Residential Sale Prices reveals that the prices in Richmond Hill vary from $10,000 to $10,000,000, with a median price of $475,000. The price range is lower than Jamaica Estates and Forest Hills but higher than South Jamaica and Jamaica Bay. The analysis also highlights that Richmond Hill's lower quartile sale price is relatively higher than that of South Jamaica and Jamaica Bay, reinforcing the affordability advantage we identified in Analysis 2.
These insights confirm that Richmond Hill is an affordable, stable, and consistently growing real estate market, appealing to homebuyers seeking affordability and investors looking for potential growth opportunities.

In conclusion, the analysis of the five-number summary on Residential Sale Prices and Gross Square Feet from 2009 to 2021 reaffirms Richmond Hill's status as an attractive real estate market. It offers a combination of affordability and growth potential, attracting a broad spectrum of homebuyers and investors. For a more detailed understanding of the market conditions, further analysis will focus on property type proportions, mean and standard deviations of Residential Sales Prices and Gross Square Feet, property type proportions, and transaction counts.
## Descriptive Statistics: Proportions, Means, Standard Deviation, and Transaction Count.
This analysis includes a comprehensive KPI set covering various aspects of the real estate market, such as property type proportions, transaction counts, residential sale price average and standard deviation, gross square feet, correlation, and covariance since 2009.

Richmond Hill is a dynamic real estate market with a high transaction count of 5,451, predominantly residential properties (0.89). Its mean residential sale price is approximately $504,549, which is lower than the overall Queens' mean of $704,176, highlighting its affordability advantage. Additionally, the standard deviation of the residential sale price in Richmond Hill is relatively lower, indicating a less volatile market than in other neighborhoods.
The mean residential gross square footage in Richmond Hill is 1830 sqft, smaller than some neighborhoods but not far from the overall Queens' with a mean of 2415 sqft. As expected, Richmond Hill has a strong correlation (0.71) between residential sale prices and gross square feet, implying that property size significantly influences sale prices.
These insights could help understand future cluster analysis, potentially grouping Richmond Hill with neighborhoods that demonstrate similar patterns. The transaction count, property type proportions, average sale price, and correlation between price and size could all be defining factors for such clustering.

In conclusion, Richmond Hill's real estate market is predominantly residential, dynamic, and affordable. Its properties show a strong correlation between size and price, making it an attractive prospect for investors and homebuyers. These findings are consistent with our previous analyses, further underpinning Richmond Hill's potential as a viable real estate office expansion location.

## Cluster Analysis: Data Preparation and KPIs
We conducted a thorough cluster analysis of 256 neighborhoods across the five boroughs of New York City. The process included data preparation, selecting Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), scaling the data, and treating outliers. 
To ensure relevance, we filtered the real estate transactions to include only those with a sale price of at least $10,000 and properties larger than 300 square feet from 2009 onwards. We selected three KPIs: median_sale_price, number_of_sales, and price_per_sqft, based on their variance and correlation analyses, providing unique and relevant clustering information. These KPIs allowed us to segment neighborhoods meaningfully for insight generation.
To achieve accurate and meaningful results, we scaled the data to ensure all KPIs were on a similar scale, and we analyzed six outliers across the three KPIs. We judged their impact on the overall analysis to be minimal and kept them in the data.
The next step is to determine the appropriate number of clusters and perform k-mean clustering on the scaled data. It is important to note that although chosen KPIs and the presence of outliers influence the insights from the cluster analysis, the insights derived represent a valuable starting point for further exploration and analysis.

## Cluster Analysis: Visualizing the Clusters
Using a scatter plot matrix, we could visualize the clusters and understand the relationships between our Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): median sale price, number of sales, and price per square foot.
The scatter plot matrix highlighted a clear distinction between the two types of neighborhoods. The red cluster represented neighborhoods with a broader range of median sale prices and a positive correlation between the number of sales and median sale price. The blue cluster, in contrast, showed more uniform median sale prices and a weaker correlation between the number of sales transactions and median sale price.

The correlation matrix provided further insights. A negative correlation (-0.352) between the median sale price and the number of sales suggested that more expensive neighborhoods tend to have fewer sales. Conversely, a strong positive correlation (0.815) between the median sale price and the price per square foot indicated that neighborhoods with higher prices also tend to have a higher price per square foot. An inverse relationship was seen between the number of sales and the price per square foot (-0.311), suggesting that neighborhoods with more sales tend to be more affordable.
Upon examining the clusters, Richmond Hill and other neighborhoods of interest were found in Cluster 2 (the blue cluster). This segmentation suggests that these neighborhoods have a more uniform median sale price and a weaker correlation between the number of sales and median sale price, reflecting a more stable and predictable real estate market.
Given the nature of the blue cluster, Richmond Hill may be a suitable location for a new real estate brokerage office. The uniform price range and weaker correlation between the number of sales and price indicate a potentially stable and predictable market that could appeal to a brokerage, as it may offer more predictable commissions and be less susceptible to large market fluctuations.
In conclusion, the EDA revealed two distinct clusters in the New York City real estate market, each with unique characteristics and trends. The neighborhood of Richmond Hill falls within a segment that might be advantageous for a new real estate brokerage office due to its more stable and predictable real estate market. In the next step, we will supplement these findings by comparing prices across neighborhoods using the Welch Two sample t-test.

## Hypothesis Test – Comparing Residential Sale Prices
Our analysis examined the average prices of residential properties in different neighborhoods of New York City, including Richmond Hill. We used t-tests to determine if there were any significant differences in the mean property prices between Richmond Hill and the other neighborhoods.

Here are the key insights we gained from our t-test analysis:
1. There is a significant difference in the mean property prices between Richmond Hill and Jamaica, Jamaica Hills, and Jamaica Estates. Richmond Hill has lower mean property prices, and the p-values confirm the statistical significance of this difference.
2. Richmond Hill has higher mean property prices than Jamaica Bay (Queens) and South Jamaica, and again, the p-values confirm the statistical significance of this difference.
3. There is no significant difference in the mean property prices between Richmond Hill and Ozone Park, as the p-value is above 0.05. However, there is a significant difference between Richmond Hill and Woodhaven, with Richmond Hill having lower average prices.
4. Richmond Hill's mean property prices are significantly lower than those of Forest Hills and Kew Gardens, as indicated by the low p-values.
These insights confirm the existence of two distinct neighborhood clusters consistent with previous analyses. They also show that Richmond Hill's property market is more affordable than other neighborhoods, which could attract more potential buyers and lead to more transactions and commissions. However, lower prices also mean lower commission amounts, and this is something the real estate company may need to consider.
In conclusion, our analysis provides valuable insights into the local real estate market, particularly for those considering establishing a new real estate brokerage office. While Richmond Hill is a good location with a less volatile market and unique pricing, the lower property prices may result in smaller commission amounts.
